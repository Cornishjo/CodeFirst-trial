  <h2> About Me. </h2>
<p> Unter den Toren, in Schatten der Stadt,
  schlaeft man gut wenn man sonst keine Schlafstelle hat.
  Keiner der fragt nach woher und wohin, denn zu kalt ist der Nacht fuer Gendarmen...

I am German and History student, attempting to learn how to code. Should be amusing.</p>

  <h3>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h3>
  <p align="justify">This is currently a boring webpage, but it will shortly become something highly exciting. "Shortly" here refers to a vague time-frame which borders on the edge of probability.</p>

<h4> About Me. </h3>
  <p align="justify"> I am a Humanities student at the University of Southampton, currently learnng about CSS, HTML and how to use various fun programs such as Atom, GitHub and Notepad. My normal background and working style involves Microsoft Word, and real copies of actual books, so turning to the Internet is something rare. I pray that this rapidly-changing world of the Internet will not kill off our precious treasure-trove of libraries!</p>

  <h5> My work. </h5>
  <p align="justify"> I currently have two projects on the go. The first involves the realm of the English East India Company (often referred to as 'John's Company') and how it interacted with the peoples during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries in the Indian Ocean. It specifically studies the lingustic side of the matter. The second is an investigation into translation theory, and the practical outworkings of this theory. As part of this, I have accepted a freelance job as a technical translator for ExtraDigital, a web marketing and SEO company based in Kent. My role there involves translating English<->German in very specific ways, and is an excellent way of testing out my theories in real life.  </p>
